# AutoGrad
This is an based Autograd engine. It incorporates backpropagation, across a dynamically constructed Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Built on this engine is a concise neural networks library that mimics PyTorch's API. This setup proves sufficient for constructing entire deep neural networks for binary classification tasks. Built for learning purposes.
